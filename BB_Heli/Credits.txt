This is a package of animated X-Plane CSL models for XSquawkBox. They were converted from Bluebell's
package of AI models for WorldTraffic. Those, in turn, were converted from FS9 freeware models.

In preparing this package, the assistance of the following people was indispensable:
* The original authors of the FS9 models (credited below)
* Bluebell
* Ben Supnik
* Keith Smith (PilotEdge)
* Chris Collins (XSquawkBox)
* Roland Winklmeier (swift)
* Nicolas Taureau & Mark Roberts (X-Plane.org)
* clumsynick
* Nick Parshukov
* RollnThndr
* marpilot
* Tompolth

Below is the original credits.txt from Bluebell's package:
