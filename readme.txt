This is a package of animated X-Plane CSL models for XSquawkBox. They were converted from Bluebell's
package of AI models for WorldTraffic. Those, in turn, were converted from FS9 freeware models.

Requires XSquawkBox 1.3.0 or later, or a pilot client that supports the XSquawkBox OBJ8 CSL format.

Extract the archive directly into the CSL directory:
C:\X-Plane 11\Resources\plugins\XSquawkBox\Resources\CSL
or whatever is the equivalent for your operating system.

It is recommended to remove the old CSL models from your system, to avoid
confusing the model matching by having different versions of the same aircraft.
